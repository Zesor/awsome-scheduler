# CalendarKit SEO Strategy & Action Plan

## 🎯 Current Situation
**Issue:** Brand new website not ranking for target keywords
**Reality:** This is 100% normal for new sites. SEO takes 3-6 months minimum.

## 📊 Why You're Not Ranking (Yet)

### 1. **Zero Domain Authority**
- Brand new domain = no trust with Google
- Competitors have years of backlinks and authority
- Solution: Build authority over time

### 2. **Highly Competitive Keywords**
Target keywords like "React calendar component" are dominated by:
- FullCalendar (10+ years old, thousands of backlinks)
- React Big Calendar (GitHub stars, community)
- Material-UI components
- Solution: Target long-tail keywords initially

### 3. **Not Indexed Yet**
- Google may not have discovered/indexed your site
- Crawling and indexing takes time
- Solution: Force indexing via Search Console
